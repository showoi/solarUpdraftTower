# Simulate tower performance

# Placeholder code - this could be replaced with actual simulation code using an engineering software package like ANSYS or COMSOL Multiphysics, or by writing custom simulation code using Python and numerical methods libraries like NumPy and SciPy.
# For example, one possible simulation could model the tower's airflow and temperature profiles using a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation, and predict the tower's energy output based on these profiles.

print("Generating performance summary and recommendations...")
# Placeholder code - this could be replaced with code that analyzes the simulation results and generates a report summarizing the tower's performance and any potential issues.
# For example, the report could include graphs of the tower's energy output under various weather conditions, as well as recommendations for optimizing the tower's design and operation to maximize its energy output and minimize any potential issues.
